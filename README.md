Welcome to My Java Restaurant, a simple console-based application created as a project for my Java Basics module. This project demonstrates fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles through a restaurant management theme.

## ðŸ“‹ Description

This application simulates a small restaurant where the user can manage a fixed budget, check the ingredient inventory, view the menu, and purchase dishes. The project is built entirely in Java and showcases core concepts like classes, objects, encapsulation, and more.

## âœ¨ Features

The application provides a console menu with the following options:

  * **Check available money:** View the current budget.
  * **View ingredient inventory:** See the list of available ingredients.
  * **See the menu:** Display all the dishes available for purchase.
  * **Buy a dish:** Purchase a plate from the menu, which updates the budget.
  * **Exit:** Close the application.

## ðŸ’¡ Concepts Applied

This project was an exercise in applying the following core Java and OOP concepts:

  * **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
      * **Classes and Objects:** `Dish`, `Ingredient`, and other entities are modeled as classes.
      * **Encapsulation:** Data is kept private within classes, accessed only through public methods.
  * **Data Structures:** Use of `ArrayList` to manage lists of ingredients and dishes.
  * **Control Flow:** Use of loops and conditional statements to run the menu and manage user interaction.
  * **Console I/O:** Reading user input and displaying information to the console.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-link>
    ```
2.  Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
3.  Compile and run the `Main` class.
